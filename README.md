# NLP News Evaluation
Project "NLP News Evaluation" for Udacity's Frontend Developer nanodegree program.

## Description
NLP News Evaluation is a web app that takes in an URL input of an online article, analyzes the content,
then prints out the result of the analysis (the subjectivity and polarity of the article).

It retrieves text analysis information of an entered URL using the Aylien API. The UI is then dynamically updated based on the returned result.

## How to Run
Start the server by running in the terminal:
```
npm run start
```
